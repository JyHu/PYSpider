    前台小姐：“hello.” 
    老外：“hi.” 
    前台小姐：“you have what thing？” 
    老外：“can you speak english？” 
    前台小姐：“if i not speak english, i am speaking what？” 
    老外：“can anybody else speak english？” 
    前台小姐：“you yourself look. all people are playing, no people have time, you can wait, you wait, you not wait, you go！ ” 
    老外：“good heavens. anybody here can speak english？” 
    前台小姐：“shout what shout, quiet a little, you on earth have what thing ?” 
    老外：“i want to speak to your head.”
